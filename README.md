# ChattingWebApplication
This is a chat application project in Nodejs Socket.IO that focuses mainly on dealing with userâ€™s messages in real-time. Also, the application displays all the available chatrooms so that a user can join and start messing around. There is no admin panel in this application. In an overview of this web application, the user has to enter a username and select any of the available chatrooms to proceed. After, the user can view available details on the chatroom and can check other present members too. In addition, the system alerts the chatroom member if any new user enters or leaves the chatroom. The rest of the thing includes chatting in real-time, but this simple project does not contain any database for storing data permanently. Besides, the user can leave the chatroom whenever he/she wants.

Last but not least, a clean and simple chatting interface is presented for displaying messages from senders and receivers with various color combinations for a greater user experience while using this simple chat application project in NodeJS, Socket.IO. For its UI elements, Vanilla CSS is on board.
